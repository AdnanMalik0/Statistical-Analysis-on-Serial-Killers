# Effects of “Motives behind murder” on the Career-Timeline of a Serial killer.

The Motives behind murder considered for this analysis are the following three:
1.	Gang, cult or organised crime:
Killers associated with gang, cult or any form Introduction
A serial killer in definition is a person who is responsible for a series of murders committed for a considerable time-period (Career-Timeline). Career-Timeline includes a starting and ending point of career (i.e., Age at First and Last kill) and the duration between the start and end point for which the killer was active. 

The intent is to present an in-detail analysis 
•	To know how Motive behind murder affects the starting point of a serial killer’s career. This will allow us to know whether a difference in motive can lead to some killers start younger than others.
•	Also, to confirm the findings of a previously done research which suggested that on an average the killer’s “Age at First kill” is 27.
of organised crime.
2.	Angel of Death:
People who work as a caretaker (e.g., nurses) and intentionally murders those who are under their care.
3.	Escape or avoid arrest:
Killers who kill in order to avoid arrest or escape from custody.

## Information about the ".R" files and Data-Analysis

The ".R" files in the Repository are used to perform appropriate data cleaning and then Hypothesis-testing for the Analysis. The order in which the files are to be run is as follows: 

1. Data Understanding.R
2. Understanding Data Distributions.R
3. Quality Checks & Hypothesis-tests I.R
4. Hypothesis-tests II.R

Refer to the file **"MAIN.pdf"**, a report showing how statistical anaylsis was done deriving outputs from these R-codes.

## Main Findings

As for our main findings, then this can be summarised in the following points:
o	Our analysis is in contradiction with the previous study which suggested that population mean of Age of killers at first kill was 27. The average age of killers at first kill seems to differ. It is lower than 27 for those who are involved in gangs and higher for those who kill to escape and those who kill people under their care. In other words, it suggests that serial killers involved in gangs start their career before the age of 27. And that serial killers who kill to escape or are Angels of death start much later around 28 years of age.

* Our analysis suggested that motives behind murder can lead to some killer start earlier than others. 
* Another point suggested by this study is that those who kill people under their care (Angels of Death) and those who kill in order to escape, typically start their career (or kills their first target) around the same age. As for those who are involved in gangs then the study suggests that they start earlier when compared.

It must be noted that even though we have some evidences to support the assumptions of our hypothesis tests, some uncertainty still remains. This is Because the assumptions made about the actual data may or may not be true. In future with access to more data a much more certain result could be sought.
